                These days Iâ€™m about 1 year into my Frontend learning and building journey.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-post-text">
                I learned so much, and thereâ€™s still so much I want to learn.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-post-text">
                First, a little bit about how it all started ðŸ˜„ 
                I had a computer at home very early because my father works with them 
                (mostly hardware). He used to play a lot of computer games. 
                So I grew up watching him do it ðŸ˜„ I also loved to play myself. 
                But my favorite games were a little bit different. 
                I loved Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. 
                My grandfather (my fatherâ€™s father) was a university teacher of some very technical things. 
                In school, I tried Basic and learned about C and Pascal, 
                but it was just a little and very simple.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-post-text">
                Still, with all this, 
                maybe due to some stereotypes that were strong around me 
                and that I couldnâ€™t resist back then, and because I had so many interests, 
                I pursued a different career. But it was still a digital one, 
                and I even got to do some design (though not very professional).
            </p>
            <p className="blog-post-text">
                Iâ€™m a bit nerdy and love to dive deep into things ðŸ˜„ 
                So then I thought, why not take it a step further and try to code myself?
            </p>
            <p className="blog-post-text">
                I started with Python but then completely 
                fell in love with Frontend development â€” 
                so much that I soon decided to change a career and work in tech.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-post-text">
                Here are the lessons I learned about learning and building projects this year,
                and my other thoughts.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-post-text">
                <span className="blog-post-text-span">1. I love to learn by building.</span> And doing so 
                would be my biggest recommendation 
                (if youâ€™d ask me) for learning efficiently.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-post-text">
                Iâ€™d like to note one important thing here. 
                Building projects in a course is great, especially solo projects 
                that you build from scratch, can rebrand, and make personal. 
                But itâ€™s so much better to build real-world products and apps 
                that are really useful to people. Itâ€™s such a great feeling 
                to be able to use what youâ€™ve learned and make something valuable. 
                As a bonus, this project can become profitable for you!
            </p>
            <p className="blog-post-text">
                <span className="blog-post-text-span">2. Try different methods to learn.</span> When 
                Iâ€™m not coding for a learning or building session, 
                I read, watch, or listen to something useful and exciting about tech. 
                I also do this when I do my make-up, cook, wash dishes, and so on ðŸ˜„ 
                Though the best way to learn to code is to code and build things.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-post-text">
                <span className="blog-post-text-span">3. Find a community</span> (or build your own) 
                for support, learning, and inspiration. 
                Try coffee chats to talk with people who are also passionate 
                about the same things you are. 
                Post about what you learn and build on social media. 
                X (Twitter) works great for me, 
                but you may find that another platform is useful for you.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-post-text">
                <span className="blog-post-text-span">4. Doing what I love.</span> There may be 
                different reasons why you want to work in the tech industry 
                and learn software development. 
                But you will make better progress and have more fun along the way 
                if you love what you do. (Iâ€™m happy to say that I do.)
            </p>
            <p className="blog-post-text">
                <span className="blog-post-text-span">5. LeetCode.</span> Learning DSA 
                can not only help you pass interviews, 
                but also, and more importantly, improve your problem-solving ability. 
                But I think itâ€™s more useful and rewarding 
                to build real-world products and solve your usersâ€™ problems.

                and will do it when I have time. 
                Itâ€™s great to learn fundamentals and get inspired by the Harvard atmosphere ðŸ¤©

            <p className="blog-post-text">
                <span className="blog-post-text-span">7. Open source.</span> Contributing 
                to open-source projects is a great way to get to work
                with a real-world codebase 
                and learn from other, more experienced developers. 
                I hope to be able to do this during Hacktoberfest soon.

                    8. Looking for my first tech job.
                </span> Why havenâ€™t I found my first tech job yet? 
                I havenâ€™t started looking for it yet ðŸ˜„ 
                This is probably my error and I need to practice passing interviews 
                and get real feedback from companies as soon as possible.

                    9. A startup, or indie-hacking.

                that will be valuable to people and businesses.

            <p className="blog-post-text">
                <span className="blog-post-text-span">10. Time and progress.</span> Progress 
                may seem slow to you, but everyone is different. 
                You have your own unique journey. 
                As long as you learn and build something every day, 
                you will get to where you want to be, step by step. 
                I couldnâ€™t even imagine how much I would be able 
                to do at this time a year ago.

                <span className="blog-post-text-span">11. Physical and mental health.</span> As obvious 
                as it sounds, you will get more done and will be able to focus better 
                if you sleep well and exercise. 
                Going for a walk is a great way to solve a problem in your code 
                when you come back, and to get a lot of exciting ideas 
                (make sure to write them down).

                </a> and working towards becoming a Frontend Developer. 
                Scrimba is awesome! The thing I love most about this platform 
                is that you build your solo projects yourself, without following a tutorial. 
                The community is also great, 
                I made some really awesome online friends ðŸ˜„

                There are a lot of things that make it harder for me, 
                like wanting to move to a safer and kinder place. 
                But almost everyoneâ€™s life is not easy, 
                and everyone can have problems that you canâ€™t even imagine. 
                Maybe itâ€™s part of the "game", 
                and if you donâ€™t have to overcome difficulties, 
                you wonâ€™t be able to fully appreciate the feeling when you win. 
                So letâ€™s see what we will do.
